\section{Solution Representation}

\subsection{Variables}
% Describe the variables used in your solution representation %
Our solution is encoded in a list of states (1 state per vehicle) that are then converted into plans. In each state we store the starting city of the vehicle and its other variables (carrying capacity and so on) and a list of the tasks assigned to him. The order in which he has to pickup and deliver those tasks depends on the position of the task inside the list.

Each task assigned to the vehicle is insereted twice into the list of tasks. When we convert the state to a plan, or compute the cost of the state, or verify that the vehicle doesn't carry too much weight for its capacity, we run through the list of tasks in order. The first time we encounter a task, we assign a pickup action. The second time, we assign a delivery action. 

\subsection{Constraints}
% Describe the constraints in your solution representation %
In our solution representation a task cannot be assigned to more than one vehicle. A vehicle also cannot carry more tasks than allowed by its carrying capacity.

To make sure of this, when we assign a new task to a vehicle we add it at the end of the task list. Which means that the vehicle will pickup and deliver all the other tasks assigned to him and only then take care of the new task. Before adding the task to the vehicle we also make sure that it doesn't weight more than the vehicle's carrying capacity. This way we can be sure that we are not giving too much weight to handle at once to a vehicle.

When we change the order in which the vehicle will pickup and deliver the task assigned to him, before validating the new order, we run through the list of tasks and make sure that he will not be carrying too much weight at any point.


\subsection{Objective function}
% Describe the function that you optimize %
Each state has a cost equals to the vehicle cost per kilometers multiplied by the total distance the vehicle will have to travel.

Our objective function is the sum of the cost of all the states.


\section{Stochastic optimization}

\subsection{Initial solution}
% Describe how you generate the initial solution %
We initialize our algorithm by assigning all the tasks to the vehicle with the highest carrying capacity. We assign them so that he will go pickup the first task, then go deliver it, then go pickup the second task, and so on.

\subsection{Generating neighbours}
% Describe how you generate neighbors %
At each iteration we generate 2 neighbours. The first one is generated by selectioning a random vehicle who has 2 or more tasks assigned to him and then 2 different tasks in his tasks list and swapping them. 

The second way is done by removing a task from one vehicle and assigning it to another vehicle. We don't use this second neighbour generation method if there is only one vehicle.

\subsection{Stochastic optimization algorithm}
% Describe your stochastic optimization algorithm %
Once we have initialized the algorithm, we run a loop for a set amount of iterations. The loop can also terminate if we get too close to the plan timeout time.

In each iteration of the loop, we generate 2 neighbours. We then compute their cost. Then, with a probability p, we go to the neighbour with the smallest cost. With a probability (1-p) we either stay in our current state or randomly pick one of the neighbours. This allows us to avoid being trapped into local minimas. We keep track of our best solution and return it once the loop terminate, either because it has done all its iterations or because it terminates early to avoid a timeout error.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Experiment 1: Model parameters}
% if your model has parameters, perform an experiment and analyze the results for different parameter values %
